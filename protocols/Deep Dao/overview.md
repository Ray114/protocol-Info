## Mission 
Born from a desire to understand more about the inner workings of the DAO ecosystem, we have created a platform that collects and organizes a variety of quantitative and qualitative data about DAOs, presenting it to the public in the form of an interactive dashboard. We are constantly expanding the metrics we collect as well as the DAO platforms we cover.

## Aim
While financial aspects of DAOs are fascinating and crucial, the heart of any DAO is its governance. As such, we dig into the inner workings of DAOs, exploring proposals, voting patterns, decentralization levels, and member activity and growth. We aspire to uncover all facets of the DAO, and love the exploration and dissection

## About
Three of the original DeepDAO members (Eyal, Daniel, and Ivan) met inside the Genesis DAO and joined forces based on our mutual curiosity about the power and potential of DAOs. Combining our complementary skillsets we set off to determine what can be known about DAOs…and then push further. Stay tuned for a variety of derivative metrics, indexes, and descriptive scores that help paint a fuller picture of each DAO that we cover.

“When it comes to analyzing DAOs, tools like DeepDAO have become a great resource to use.” - Delphi Digital

“If CMC went for $400m because it provided data on the suddenly booming longtail of tokens, then it stands to reason the next big data play in crypto is DAO metrics” - Joon Wong

DeepDAO: Look broad, go deep.
